                    <p>This shoe brand makes their shoes from fair trade in Africa, with each purchase, an African worker gets a fair share of the pay and gets help for their village. The shoes are refurbished from used tires. The shoe brand want to see that this is a fair trade product from Africa in their design. With that in mind, I started designing the stylescape.</p><br />
                    <p>I looked for African patterns and colors and found some patterns that I customized and used an African color pallet. The font I used is a traditional African font, and for the subheadings and body I used a light and bold Europa font for a modern feel. I used in almost all my designs the brown and yellow colors. I wanted to use the cream and blue colors for the website.</p>
