              <p className="fz-18">Everything Blik Reclame and me made in graphic design for the restaurant derives from the logo. Because the customer was very pleased with the logo I created, making other products such as business cards, gift vouchers and contributing to the web design was fairly easy. In conclusion, I took the role of lead graphic designer for the branding of Grand Caf√© INTI. The customer was very pleased with the results and the restaurant is doing very well with delicious food, many customers and even showing up in the local newspaper.</p><br /><br />
